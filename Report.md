# ParallelComputing CSCE 435 Group project

## 1. _due 10/27_ Group members:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
4. Fourth

---

## 2. _due 11/03_ Project topic 

## 2. _due 11/03_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)

## 3. _due 11/12_ Pseudocode for each algorithm and implementation

## 3. _due 11/12_ Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare

For example:
- Effective use of a GPU (play with problem size and number of threads)
- Strong scaling to more nodes (same problem size, increase number of processors)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)

## 4. _due 11/19_ Performance evaluation

Include detailed analysis of computation performance, communication performance.

Include figures and explanation of your analysis.
