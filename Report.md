## 2. _due 10/25_ Project topic

We will implement 3 parallel sorting algorithms (bubble, quick, and merge sort) in MPI and CUDA. We will examine and compare their performance in detail (computation time, communication time, how much data is sent) on a variety of inputs: sorted, random, reverse, sorted with 1% perturbed, etc.  Strong scaling, weak scaling, GPU performance.

## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)

- Bubble Sort (MPI + CUDA)
- Quick Sort (MPI + CUDA)
- Merge Sort (MPI + CUDA)
